Older, end-of-life versions of VxWorks back to 6.5 are also affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below. All versions of the discontinued product Advanced Networking Technology (ANT) are likely affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below. The VxWorks bootrom network stack leverages the same IPnet source as VxWorks and, as a result, is also technically vulnerable to CVE-2019-12256. The same patches and mitigations apply to VxWorks and the bootrom network stack; however, the bootrom normally uses statically assigned IP-addresses, not DHCP. If that is true, then the defects related to those protocols do not apply in practice. Also, a successful exploit of the bootrom network stack has a more difficult timing component. In typical applications, the bootrom does not listen to TCP-ports, which means that the TCP-related issues must be timed with the target downloading data from the network. VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x may be affected. Contact Wind River customer support (support@windriver.com) for more details. The following VxWorks products are not affected: The latest release of VxWorks, VxWorks 7 SR620, is NOT affected by any of these CVEs VxWorks 5.3 through VxWorks 6.4 inclusive are NOT affected. VxWorks Cert versions are NOT affected. VxWorks 653 Versions 2.x and earlier are NOT affected. VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x Cert Edition and later are NOT affected.

The following RTOS are affected: ENEA reports that OSE4 and OSE5 may have been bundled with Interpeak IPnet from 2004-2006. In 2007, ENEA replaced Interpeak IPnet with OSENet. Green Hills Software reports Interpeak IPnet was a third-party add-on for INTREGRITY RTOS from 2003-2006. Wind River reports the following versions of VxWorks are affected: All versions of VxWorks under CURRENT support (6.9.4.11, Vx7 SR540, Vx7 SR610) are affected by one or more of the CVE numbers detailed below. Older, end-of-life versions of VxWorks back to 6.5 are also affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below. All versions of the discontinued product Advanced Networking Technology (ANT) are likely affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below. The VxWorks bootrom network stack leverages the same IPnet source as VxWorks and, as a result, is also technically vulnerable to CVE-2019-12256. The same patches and mitigations apply to VxWorks and the bootrom network stack; however, the bootrom normally uses statically assigned IP-addresses, not DHCP. If that is true, then the defects related to those protocols do not apply in practice. Also, a successful exploit of the bootrom network stack has a more difficult timing component. In typical applications, the bootrom does not listen to TCP-ports, which means that the TCP-related issues must be timed with the target downloading data from the network. VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x may be affected. Contact Wind River customer support (support@windriver.com) for more details. The following VxWorks products are not affected: The latest release of VxWorks, VxWorks 7 SR620, is NOT affected by any of these CVEs VxWorks 5.3 through VxWorks 6.4 inclusive are NOT affected. VxWorks Cert versions are NOT affected. VxWorks 653 Versions 2.x and earlier are NOT affected. VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x Cert Edition and later are NOT affected.
