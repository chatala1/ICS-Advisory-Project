# ICS Advisory Project ##
The ICS Advisory Project is an open-source project to provide clean and usable DHS CISA ICS Advisories data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. This format better supports vulnerability analysis for the OT/ICS community, which is difficult to perform in the current ICS-CERT Advisory HTML format. The ICS-CERT Advisories data also supports the other project goal: ICS-CERT Advisory Dashboard. The dashboard provides smaller ICS/OT assets owners with a tool to quickly filter the view of vulnerabilities affecting vendors/products within their environment. This project is by no means a replacement for the original CISA ICS Advisories, and I highly recommend anyone using this dataset to refer to and read them.

While some of this dataset may seem duplicative of CVE data, CISA ICS Advisories have been providing additional insight not provided in a CVE, such as Vendor headquarters locations, Product distributions, and Critical Infrastructure sectors for each vendor product. This additional data is valuable to Security and Industry researchers to understand potential supply chain risks associated with vendor production locations and vulnerabilities across specific critical infrastructure sectors. 

Don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:icsadvisoryproj@icsadvisoryproject.com) if you have questions about the project or suggestions to improve, expand, and protect this data source.
